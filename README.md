Challenge for developer position

This challenge includes a simple Flask server for the backend, and a simple HTML and vanilla JS front end, with styling by Bootstrap.

To run this challenge, clone the repository to your local machine.

Navigate to the `backend` folder, and create a virtual environment by running `$ python -m venv venv` and `$ source venv/bin/activate`. 

Install the necessary packages by running `$ pip install -r requirements.txt`. Once done, the server can be run this way:

```
$ export FLASK_APP=backend.py
$ flask run
```

The server should then be running on localhost:5000.

Once the server is running, navigate to the `frontend` folder, and run `$ open index.html`. The app should be up and fully functional.
